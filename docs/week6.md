# Week 6

* Made tests for the IDA*
* Fixed bugs with other operating systems

## What I have done

During this week, I have made some tests for the IDA* -algorithm and fixed some bugs encountered with different operating systems. Refactored the code and improved documentation.

## Encountered problems

Pythons import errors became troublesome, fixed by using absolute paths with every class.

## What to do next

I plan to make more tests for the IDA* algorithm, finish everything and improving my code structures. Will build a new pattern database with (6, 6, 3) heuristics to find better heuristics.

## Hours used

I used about 6 hours in total coding the application this week.
