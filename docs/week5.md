# Week 5

* IDA* algorithm completed
* Implemented the Solve -function in the user interface

## What I have done

During this week, I have completed the implementation of the IDA* algorithm and integrated it into the graphical user interface. The algorithm now uses the 'patterns.dat' pattern database for heuristics.

## Encountered problems

Encountered some problems where the algorithm could have trouble if the permutation is not in the 'patterns.dat'. To handle this issue, I may need to implement additional error handling functions such as Manhattan distance. Did not have time to make meaningful tests for the algorithm.

## What to do next

I plan to make (more) tests for the IDA* algorithm and improving my code structures to enhance the overall quality of the application. Also, will find out if my algorithm or pattern database can be more optimized, since it takes long time sometimes to find the goal. Probably have to build a new pattern database with (6, 6, 3) heuristics.

## Hours used

I used about 10 hours in total coding the application and researching about data structures and algorithms.
