# Week 3

* UI almost completed
* Too much time went to it from the courses perspective

## What I have done

I had to learn how to use new library, Tkinter. Now the UI works nicely, and now the algorithms are the only work I have left. I have been also reading and studying the IDA* algorithm, and will implement a pattern database for the application. Probably include the database in the application, since building it can take a very long time. 

## Encountered problems

Encountered problems with Pygame -library and had to suddenly change to using Tkinter -library for the UI, and this added additional work. 

## What to do next

Next week I can finally implement the IDA* -algorithm and forget about working on the UI. I will implement the pattern database, heuristics and then IDA* algorithm for it, and then store the route to show in the UI.

## Hours used

I used about 8 hours in total coding the application.
