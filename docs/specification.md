# Specification document :eight_spoked_asterisk:

This aim of this project is to implement a GUI program, where the user can fill in the slots with numbers for the 15 Puzzle, and then execute it to show the
optimal moves step by step to solve it. 

The program will use IDA* algorithm to solve the optimal path and will be programmed by Python. 

I am also capable of programming in Java and can also do the peer reviews for those projects. I am a student for  bachelorâ€™s in computer science. 
Documentation is done using Markdown.
