# Week 1

* Researched different topics for the lab course
* Studied different algorithms, including Minimax, K-Nearest Neighbors & IDA*
* Chose my topic for the course and algorithms & data structures to use
* Initialized the repository for my project

## What I have done

Most of the time has gone to studying different algorithms and project ideas. I learned how K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm works to recognize numbers
in handwritten images, how Minimax algorithm can find optimal move to play against someone for example in TicTacToe & Chess. 

Learned also the basics how the RSA encryption algorithm works.

## Encountered problems

I did not counter a lot of problems yet, still studying how to implement the IDA* algorithm to solve the 15 Puzzle. 

## What to do next

Next week I will start the Python project and first implement graphical user interface to show the puzzle, then I will implement the IDA* algorithm to solve the puzzle. 

I also will also implement unit tests for this program. I hope that I have working runnable program for the deadline.
