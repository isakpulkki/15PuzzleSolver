# Week 2

* Created the Puzzle object
* Created the main application using pygame
* Created unittests
* Added CI, Codecov and instructions

## What I have done

I started doing actual work and coding. Coded the Puzzle component and functionalities for it, implemented the UI with pygame library and ended up with runnable application still without functionalities for user input. Made unittests for the Puzzle object, added CI and Codecov. Made instructions how to use the program.

## Encountered problems

Encountered problems with Python, because I am used to things handled like in Java.

## What to do next

Next week I will add functionality for the user to make moves in application, and start implementing the IDA* algorithm to solve the puzzle. If I have time, make buttons to the UI to execute the IDA*. If everything goes well, maybe add other algorithms also.

## Hours used

I used about 8 hours in total coding, adding the CI, Codecov etc.
